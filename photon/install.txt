- Move the Photon Javascript SDK to a location of your choice,
    e.g. C:\Photon\sample.
    
- Optionally configure the Flash Plugin

    This step is only needed if you open the samples via file browser
    (URL file://...) and only for browsers not natively supporting
    websockets ... and/or if you explicitly test the Fash fallback.
    
    Repeat this with the browser of your choice.
